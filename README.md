🌾 Agri-RAG: Safe Agricultural Question Answering System

Agri-RAG is a document-grounded, safety-first Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system designed for agriculture use cases.
It answers farmer questions only from verified documents, refuses when information is missing, and avoids unsafe hallucinations — especially for numeric and dosage-related queries.

This project is built as part of Agri-Connect, focusing on reliability, traceability, and multilingual support, not flashy AI demos.
